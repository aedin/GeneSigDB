HT-29 monolayers were infected with S. dublin or left uninfected as controls, and total RNA was extracted at 3, 8, and 20 h after infection. Radioactive cDNA was prepared and hybridized to the GF211 Human “Known Genes” GeneFilter Release I membranes, which carries ;4,000 cDNA EST probes. The manufacturer of the GF211 GeneFilter membrane (Research Genetics) conducted homology searches for the ESTs using standard DNA databases and assigned names of known genes to the probes. These assignments were carefully checked for all probes shown in the table and several additional probes and were found to be correct for 78% (50 of 64) of all EST probes reanalyzed. No good matches (i.e. those encompassing at least 100 base pairs with at least 98% homology located at the 39 end of the cDNA of a known human gene) could be found for the remaining 22% (14 of 64) of EST probes, using the BLAST search capability of the GenBank™ database. Results from these poorly matching EST probes were discarded for the present studies, because they did not represent known human genes. Data from the cDNA probes with good matches, including their accession numbers and the names, accession numbers, and selected characteristics and functions of the genes showing the best matches in the homology searches, are shown in the table.

Gene expression profile after As-ODN inhibited SYT-SSX expression,Total RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen  Hilden  Germany) after 14 h As- or Mis-ODNs treatment. Human Cancer 1.2 Arrays Filters containing 1176 genes was purchased from Clontech (Germany). The probes labelling and hybridization were performed according to the manufacturer?s instructions. In brief  3 mg total RNA was converted into cDNA and labelled with [33P]dATP using the Clontech cDNA array labelling kit. The cDNA probes were then hybridized to the array filters. After washing the filters were exposed to imaging plates (BAS-MP 2040S; Fuji  Kanagawa  Japan) and scanned bya phosphorimager (Bio-Imaging Analyzer  BAS-2500; Fuji) with high-resolution (16 bit) tiff-format images. The images were imported and analysed using Atlas image analysis software (Clontech). To ensure the optimum quality of the hybridizations  one filter was maximally used twice. In order to confirm the reproducibility of the results  each sample was hybridized twice with different filters. The two independent hybridization images were then compared to each other using the Atlas Image software (Clontech) to avoid anymisinte rpretation. In our analysis  we divided genes into two categories according to their expression ratios (treated/untreated cells)  upregulated (ratio X2.0) and downregulated (ratio p0.5). *Signal intensityof genes from treated cells/signal intensityof genes from untreated (¬Lipofectin-treated) cells. **A measure of 0.5 mg of DNase-1-treated total RNA was reversed to cDNA byusing first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Roche  Mnnheim  Germany). The PCR primers (TIB MOLBIOL Germany) are presented in Table 2. Standard curves were obtained by using serial dilutions of beta-globulin gene (DNA Control kit  Roche). PCR solution contains one mixture (DNA Fast Start Master SYBR Green 1 mix  Roche) with 1 ml of cDNA and 5?10 pmol of the primers. The PCR process was started at 951C for 12 min  then followed 45 cycles at 951C for 10 s  60?651C for 5 s and 721C for 10?20 s. Amplifications were followed by melting curve analysis using one cycle at 981C with 0 s hold  651C with 10 s hold and 951C with 0 s hold in the acquisition step mode. A negative control without cDNA template was run with everyassay . The expression of each gene was determined on the basis of kinetic approach using the LightCycler software. ***Ratio: Observed gene expressions in treated synovial cells/observed gene expressions in untreated (¬Lipofectin-treated) cells.,,http://pubget.com/search?q=14576825#,14576825-Table1.txt,,8,GenBank ID,Gene Description,Geneset Specific Statistics,Geneset Specific Statistics,Geneset Specific Statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To qualify as differentially expressed  the change had to exceed 2.0-fold in at least two experiments. The mean ratio of three experiments is shown. b To identify E2F3-binding sites  promoter regions was identified using Dragon Promoter Finder in Transplorer (Biobase GmbH  Wolfenbüttel  Germany) in the 5000 bp upstream region and the first exon of each of the differentially expressed genes. These sequences were searched for E2F-binding sites by a Matrix Search using E2F M00803 and E2F M00050 that are E2F3 specific  at 95% stringency. + indicates that an E2F3-binding site has been found  - that it was nor found in the promoter region searched  and N/A  the promoter region could not be identified,,,16909110-Table1.txt,,102,GenBank ID,Gene Symbol,Geneset Specific Statistics,Geneset Specific Factor,Other Gene Description,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Regulated genes (ratio>2  n=28) in K18Y-TATI tumor xenografts versus HT-29 5M21 tumor xenografts at 41 days post inoculation of the cancer cells in SCID mice  and their corresponding GenBank accession numbers, Downregulated genes: CSPG4 (also called NG2 or MCSP) encodes a proteoglycan expressed by several tumor types and promotes cancer progression through FAK and ERK signaling pathways (Yang et al.  2004; Makagiansar et al.  2007); BMP7 is a member of the TGF-superfamily involved in colon cancer cell invasion (Grijelmo et al.  2007). CHRD is a BMP antagonist highly expressed in the basal crypt stromal cells versus the apical surface of the human colon mucosa (Van der Zee et al.  2006; Kosinski et al.  2007). Our data demonstrate that human colon cancer cells HT29 5M21 cells also express the CHRD gene  in a regulated manner; IGFBP2 is upregulated in human solid tumors and was recently shown to promote cancer progression (Dunlap et al.  2007); HPN is a recently identified transmembrane serine protease stimulating the invasive potential of prostate cancer cells (Klezovitch et al.  2006; Xuan et al.  2006). The upregulated gene CCL2/MCP-1 encodes a chemokine secreted by cancer cells. CCL2 display chemotactic activities for the infiltration of the tumor stroma by monocytes  neutrophils and mesenchymal stem cells. Conflicting reports and multiple roles of CCl2 in cancer progression are therefore reported  involving the promotion of tumor growth  angiogenesis and metastasis  or instead  metastasis inhibition. Of note  patients with pancreatic cancer and high circulating levels of CCL2 have significantly higher survival rate than those with low CCL2 serum levels. Thus  the biological significance of CCL2 in cancer progression appears particularly complex and may vary according to the tumor types and progression since this chemokine may impair cancer cell cycle progression and survival  via the inducible NO synthase and NO-mediated G1-arrest (Monti et al.  2003; Hu et al.  2007; Loberg et al.  2007).,,,18317448-Table2.txt,,28,GenBank ID,Gene Description,Geneset Specific Statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tenfold cross validation on trial 1 resulted in eight different DAMIP predictive signatures, each of which had a tenfold unbiased estimate of 93% prediction rate in trial 1. SLC2A6 and EIF2AK4 are represented in several signatures. Blind prediction of rules developed from trial 1 on trial 2 data produced prediction accuracies in the 80-90% range. Tenfold blind predictions were also carried out to evaluate the consistency of the classification rules obtained by subsets of training data only. Here, for trial 1, rule 1 in the tenfold blind test, nine of the ten resulting rules resulted in 80% correct prediction on the blind data from trial 2, and one rule resulted in 90% correct prediction. Thus, the average unbiased prediction rate on the blind data was 81%. However, when we generated the classification rules using the entire training set, they predicted the blind data with an accuracy of 80% singlefold blind test). Conversely, 14 different discriminatory predictive signatures were obtained when trial 2 was used as the training set, with unbiased classification rates in the range 90–100%. EIF2AK4 and SLC2A6 were also represented in thesemodels. Blind prediction on independent trial 1 yielded 73–87% prediction accuracy. Although gene expression data across various time points were all input into the predictive model, most of the discriminatory signature sets (16 out of 22) consisted of only the day 7 expression relative to the day 0.",,,,19029902-Table2.txt,,9,Other Gene Description,Gene Symbol,UniGene ID,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
